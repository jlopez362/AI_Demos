## Examples

### Image Description
Example based on the post [Image to Text with Semantic Kernel and HuggingFace](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/image-to-text-with-semantic-kernel-and-huggingface/)
where Semantic Kernel is used with the Hugging Face connector to generate text based on images.

For the example, Blazor was used as the presentation layer, unlike the example that uses WinForms.
